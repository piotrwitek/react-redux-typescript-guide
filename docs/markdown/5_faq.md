# FAQ

### - should I still use React.PropTypes in TS?
> No. With TypeScript, using PropTypes is an unnecessary overhead. When declaring IProps and IState interfaces, you will get complete intellisense and compile-time safety with static type checking. This way you'll be safe from runtime errors and you will save a lot of time on debugging. Additional benefit is an elegant and standardized method of documenting your component external API in the source code.

### - when to use `interface` declarations and when `type` aliases?
> From practical side, using `interface` declaration will display identity (interface name) in compiler errors, on the contrary `type` aliases will be unwinded to show all the properties and nested types it consists of. This can be a bit noisy when reading compiler errors and I like to leverage this distinction to hide some of not so important type details in errors

### - how to best initialize class instance or static properties?
> Prefered modern style is to use class Property Initializers  
```tsx
class StatefulCounterWithInitialCount extends React.Component<Props, State> {
  // default props using Property Initializers
  static defaultProps: DefaultProps = {
    className: 'default-class',
    initialCount: 0,
  };
  
  // initial state using Property Initializers
  state: State = {
    count: this.props.initialCount,
  };
  ...
}
```

### - how to best declare component handler functions?
> Prefered modern style is to use Class Fields with arrow functions  
```tsx
class StatefulCounter extends React.Component<Props, State> {
// handlers using Class Fields with arrow functions
  handleIncrement = () => {
    this.setState({ count: this.state.count + 1 });
  };
  ...
}
```
