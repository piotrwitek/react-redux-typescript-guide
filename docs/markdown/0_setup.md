# Type Definitions & Complementary Libraries

### Type Definitions for React & Redux
```
npm i -D @types/react @types/react-dom @types/react-redux
```

"react" - `@types/react`  
"react-dom" - `@types/react-dom`  
"redux" - (types included with npm package)*  
"react-redux" - `@types/react-redux`  

> *NB: Guide is based on types from Redux v4.x.x (Beta). To make it work with Redux v3.x.x please refer to [this config](https://github.com/piotrwitek/react-redux-typescript-guide/blob/master/playground/tsconfig.json#L5))  

### Complementary Libraries
> Utility libraries **with focus on type-safety** providing a light functional abstractions for common use-cases

- ["utility-types"](https://github.com/piotrwitek/utility-types) - Utility Types for TypeScript (think lodash for types, moreover provides migration from Flow's Utility Types)  
- ["typesafe-actions"](https://github.com/piotrwitek/typesafe-actions) - Typesafe Action Creators for Redux / Flux Architectures (in TypeScript)
